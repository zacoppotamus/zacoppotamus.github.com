<p>Left is a clean, whitespace-happy layout for <a href='https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll'>Jekyll</a>.</p>

<p>This is designed to be an easy layout to modify for your own blog. It was extracted from <a href='http://zachholman.com'>zachholman.com</a>, which means it was battle-hardened from years of posting serious blog posts about emoji and swear words.</p>

<p>You&#8217;re actually reading an example post right now. See how cool it is? Oh, be quiet, you&#8217;re making me blush.</p>

<p>You&#8217;ll want to <a href='https://github.com/holman/left#readme'>get the code</a> and read the README to learn how to install and set up Left for your own purposes.</p>
