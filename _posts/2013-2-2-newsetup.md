I recently decided I'd had enough of squinting at my 15-inch Macbook's screen. While I always tried to make the most out of my current screen estate, constantly having a .pdf or Chrome tab on one side for reference while also enabling the dual column layout on Sublime Text had a great impact on my productivity. Therefore, after weighing the pros and cons of buying a new monitor, I decided it would be a worthwhile investment.

Choosing a monitor
---
Three factors came into play when chossing a suitable monitor. Size, design and price.
I decided anything bigger than 24 inches would be overkill given my current desk size and budget. I also didn't want to strain my eyes by being so close to such a large screen.

The [Dell UltraSharp U2412M](http://www.amazon.com/Dell-UltraSharp-U2412M-LED-Monitor/dp/B005JN9310) was one of few monitors I saw matching these prerequisites. Additionally, the IPS panel, rotate ability, energy management and anti-glare coating were features I was eagerly looking forward to.

During the initial setup, I noticed that the color temperature was a bit cold compared to the MacBook's so a bit of calibration was in order. Otherwise, setting it up as my primary display was quite easy.

Magic Mouse or Trackpad?
---
In terms of peripherals, I was set from the start on buying a wireless Apple keyboard. However choosing a mouse was not as simple. After much deliberation over whether I should buy the Trackpad or the Magic Mouse, I decided on the former. The main reasons for this were:

1. My desk was quite small, and therefore not accommodating for large movements.
2. I didn't want to miss out on all the 3 and 4-finger gestures I'd gotten used to on the MacBook's trackpad.
3. By having the Trackpad right next to the keyboard I would minimize the amount of hand movement when switching between that and the keyboard.

*(After 3 weeks of usage, I'm quite certain that I made the right decision)*

Keyboard Layouts
---
So I went and bought the keyboard and Trackpad from the Apple Store here in Bristol. However one thing I wasn't aware of were the (subtle) differences between keyboard layouts - namely US and UK ones. Due to my MacBook being purchased from the States, I had grown used to that layout and kept hitting the wrong keys while coding with the new, UK, keyboard. Having the **enter** key, one of the most commonly used ones be so small struck me as incredibly stupid. But I digress.

Thankfully returning the keyboard to the Apple Store was a piece of cake. One caveat was that they didn't have the one I wanted in stock, which forced me to order one online from the central store in London (which arrived promptly the next day).

Conclusion

I believe that buying an external monitor was definitely a quality investment. My productivity has greatly increased, and the amount of distractions are kept to a minimum. Programmer or not, if you spend an above-average amount of time in front of a computer screen, having two of them will work wonders.
